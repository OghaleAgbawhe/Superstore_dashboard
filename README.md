# Superstore_dashboard
Welcome to my Tableau dashboard designed to analyze and identify the least profitable items in an inventory. This dashboard focuses on helping to understand the profitability of different items and their performance across various locations. Some items though not profitable overall, have made profit at times in various locations.

# Key features:

Overall Profitability Analysis: The dashboard provides an overview of the profitability of each item, allowing you to quickly identify the least profitable ones. The items are ranked based on their net profit, enabling you to prioritize further analysis.

Location-Based Profitability: This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the profitability of items across different locations. By selecting a specific location, you can view detailed insights into the profit trends for each item. This helps in identifying items that may not be profitable overall but have shown profitability in specific locations.

Historical Profit Analysis: The dashboard provides historical data analysis, allowing you to evaluate whether an item has always been unprofitable or if it has had profitable periods. This analysis helps you make informed decisions about whether to eliminate an item entirely or consider strategies to improve its profitability.

Drill-Down Capabilities: With interactive drill-down features, you can delve deeper into specific items, viewing their profitability trends over time and their performance across different locations. This enables you to identify any patterns, seasonal variations, or other factors that may impact profitability.
